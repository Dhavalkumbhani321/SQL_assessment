Now make sure to solve the following query:-

1). Write sql query to find the nobel prize winners of the year 1970. Return year,subject 
and winner.
--> SELECT yearr,subject,winner FROM nobel_win WHERE yearr=1970;

    
2). Write sql query to find the nobel prize winners in chemistry between the years 1965 
and 1975. Begin and end values are included. Return year, subject, winner and 
country.
-->  SELECT yearr,subject,winner,country FROM nobel_win WHERE subject = "Chemistry"
     AND yearr>=1965 AND yearr<=1975;
              
     
3). Write sql query to retrieve the details of the winners whose first name matches with 
the string ‘Louis’. Return year,subject,winner,country.
-->  SELECT * FROM nobel_win WHERE winner LIKE "Louis %";
     
4). Write sql query to find Nobel prize winners for the subject that does not begin with 
the letter ‘P’. Order the result by year, descending and winner in ascending
--> SELECT * FROM nobel_win WHERE subject not like 'P' ORDER BY yearr DESC,winner;


5). Write sql query to find the details of 1970 Nobel prize winners. Order the result by 
subject, ascending except for ‘Chemistry’ and ‘Economics’ which will come at the 
end of the result set. Return year, subject, winner,country and categor.
-->SELECT * FROM nobel_win WHERE yearr=1970 ORDER BY CASE WHEN subject IN ("Chemistry", "Economics") THEN 1
    ELSE 0
    END ASC,subject,winner;
